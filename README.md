### Integration Best Practice

Create optimal payment experiences for your customers by following these [best practices](https://global.alipay.com/doc/ams_upm/bp) for integrations.

### Using API Mock

We provide an API mocking tool(currently in BETA version) for you to easily test exceptional cases. 

Below are some of the default out-of-box mocking rules that basically use the payment amount value to identify the desired mock response:

|API|when which input parameter|equals what|then you get a response of|
|---|---|---|---|
|ams/api/v1/payments/pay|payToAmount.value|9901|UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION|
|ams/api/v1/payments/pay|payToAmount.value|9902|network timeout|
|ams/api/v1/payments/inquiryPayment|payToAmount.value of the corresponding PAY request|9903|UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION|
|ams/api/v1/payments/inquiryPayment|payToAmount.value of the corresponding PAY request|9904|network timeout|

To use this mocking tool:

1. Set gatewayUrl=https://isandbox.alipaydev.com
2. Set alipayPublicKey to a fixed value that you can get from us through sandbox_service@alibaba-inc.com.

### Acceptance testing

Pass all the acceptance test cases in the Alipay Developer Center to ensure a high quality integration. Especially, test exceptions by using test cases.
